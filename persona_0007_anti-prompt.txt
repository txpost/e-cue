Help me with [task], but DO NOT: [list of things you're tired of seeing]. Instead, focus on [what you actually want]. If you catch yourself falling into any of the 'do not' patterns, stop and restart that section.

Example: "Help me write a LinkedIn post about my career change, but DO NOT: use the words 'delighted' or 'thrilled', start with a question, include any humble brags, or use more than one emoji. Focus on being genuine and specific."
