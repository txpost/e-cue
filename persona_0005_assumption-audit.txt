Before answering [question], list out every assumption you're making about my situation, resources, audience, or goals. Number them. Then answer the question, and afterwards tell me which assumptions, if wrong, would most change your advice.

Example: "Before recommending a social media strategy, list every assumption you're making about my business, audience, and resources. Then give your recommendation and tell me which wrong assumptions would most change your advice."
