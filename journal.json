Before we dive in, I'd like to briefly establish our shared language.\n\nWe'll be using the Mood Meter framework, which considers two dimensions: energy (how much mental or physical energy you have) and pleasantness (how positive or enjoyable the experience is). We'll use this framework to notice, name, and regulate your emotions.\n\nTo begin, let's scan where you are on the Mood Meter today. On a scale of 1-4, how would you rate your current energy level? And on a scale of 1-4, how pleasant do you find your current situation?\n\n(Note: Please respond with numbers for both energy and pleasantness.)"
